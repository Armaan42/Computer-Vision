## Experiment 1: Implement and demonstrate the Data Processing for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

### steps Involved:
- Read Training Date from CSV file.
- Preprocess the Data (Extract Features and Target Labels).
- Apply the <b>Find-S Algorithm</b> (Initialize and update the most specific hypothesis).
- Display the Final Hypothesis.

## Experiment 2: For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Data Visualization to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

### steps Involved:
- Load Training Data from a .CSV file.
- Apply <b>Candidate Elimination Algorithm</b> to find:
    - Most Specific Hypothesis (S)
    - Most Specific Hypothesis (S)
- Visualize Hypotheses using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
